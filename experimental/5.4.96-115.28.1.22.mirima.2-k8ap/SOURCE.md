# Drivers for kernel 5.4.96-115.28.1.22.mirima.2 on the K8Ap chip (experimental)

**Not tested on a TV yet.**  `get-driver` doesn't offer them.  `test-driver` (or Test a new driver in the LG-USB-2-ETH0 app) tries one: see [Testing one](https://github.com/ohmybahgosh/LG-USB-2-ETH0/blob/main/docs/driver-build.md#testing-one).

- **Built by:** [OhMyBahGosh](https://github.com/ohmybahgosh), with [LG-USB-2-ETH0's scripts/driver-build/build.sh](https://github.com/ohmybahgosh/LG-USB-2-ETH0/tree/main/scripts/driver-build)
- **TVs:** TVs with Realtek's K8Ap chip, on firmware 04.54 (webOS 22).  Only for that chip: other chips run the same kernel name with their own config
- **Kernel source:** LG Open Source package "webOS 22 KLP_12.0" (for the 55UQ8000), `repo/kernel-1.0.0-114.tar.gz`, with `CHIP_NAME=k8`.
- **Config:** the one built into the TV's own kernel, taken from LG's firmware for that kernel and chip
- **License:** GPL-2.0, like the kernel and drivers they're built from

## r8152_oot.ko

- **Driver:** Realtek's r8152 v2.22.1 as DonZoomik patched it, renamed `r8152_oot` so it can sit beside an old built-in `r8152`.  The same source as [`drivers/5.4.268-329.ptl4tv.5/source`](../../drivers/5.4.268-329.ptl4tv.5/source)
- **Adapters:** Realtek RTL8152, RTL8153 and RTL8156
- **SHA-256:** `01e46f3241637977fe2c7539199b81b224a006631d572059b9b38b52714876ee`
- **Checks:** `vermagic=5.4.96-115.28.1.22.mirima.2 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`, the kernel has MODVERSIONS and module signing off, and all 127 symbols it imports are exported by the TV's kernel.  USB struct offsets: not checked, so it needs a tester.

## ax88179_178a.ko

- **Driver:** the kernel's own `ax88179_178a` driver (drivers/net/usb/ax88179_178a.c), which LG leaves out of this kernel
- **Adapters:** ASIX AX88179 and AX88178A
- **SHA-256:** `90ef60771f0e328675a3c36e8445d9eaa8e9ea9522744d45f63fbe79b73c3820`
- **Checks:** `vermagic=5.4.96-115.28.1.22.mirima.2 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`, the kernel has MODVERSIONS and module signing off, and all 47 symbols it imports are exported by the TV's kernel.  USB struct offsets: not checked, so it needs a tester.

## aqc111.ko

- **Driver:** `drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c` from the same LG kernel source, built as a module, since this kernel leaves it out
- **Adapters:** Aquantia AQC111U and AQC112 (5G and 2.5G), and the ASIX, TRENDnet and QNAP adapters built on them
- **SHA-256:** `64a8f2deee594984f1985ba43ee1ef84583c85f3f506e7feb6477f1a38c0a310`
- **Checks:** `vermagic=5.4.96-115.28.1.22.mirima.2 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`, and all 50 symbols it imports are exported by the TV's kernel.  USB struct offsets: not checked, so it needs a tester.

## dm9601.ko

- **Driver:** `drivers/net/usb/dm9601.c` from the same LG kernel source, built as a module, since this kernel leaves it out
- **Adapters:** Davicom DM9601 and the 100 Mbit adapters built on it
- **SHA-256:** `5aafbc69ae9b9426f5817ed28a055ab2d3c47d9ec014fc65cb5385668a36747b`
- **Checks:** `vermagic=5.4.96-115.28.1.22.mirima.2 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`, and all 44 symbols it imports are exported by the TV's kernel.  USB struct offsets: not checked, so it needs a tester.

## lan78xx.ko

- **Driver:** `drivers/net/usb/lan78xx.c` from the same LG kernel source, built as a module, since this kernel leaves it out
- **Adapters:** Microchip LAN7800 and LAN7850
- **SHA-256:** `9aed686def3b4bff5af9fd8fa32b69778e64eaf2b0f921c20fa8bdba0e34f891`
- **Checks:** `vermagic=5.4.96-115.28.1.22.mirima.2 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`, and all 136 symbols it imports are exported by the TV's kernel.  USB struct offsets: not checked, so it needs a tester.

`build-*` files are from the build: each module's info, the symbols it imports, and how the build config differs from the TV's.
